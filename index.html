		Welcome to BGS Webchem! Here you will find some online tutorials and assignments to help you work your way through A-level Chemistry.
	      </p>
	      <ul>
		<li>You will find a checklist in each topic. Use the checklist as the basis of your revision. Each skill listed is a point from the <a href="http://ocr.org.uk/Images/171720-specification-accredited-a-level-gce-chemistry-a-h432.pdf">OCR specification</a>. The specification is basically a list of things you can be examined on, and it is worth using the checklists to make sure you have covered and understood all of the things that you need to in order to pass. </li>
		<li>You will find pre-lesson assignments in each topic. The pre-lesson assignment must be completed before the lesson, and will form the basis of your neat notes. In class, you will be practising the skills you need to answer exam questions and deepen your understanding, so you must turn up being able to define and understand the key terms for the lesson, as well as have a grasp of the basic ideas covered. Do these in your neat book. </li>
		<li>You will find practice questions in each topic, and these should form the basis of your revision. Having practised and mastered skills in class, ensure you practise your exam technique against the clock. </li>
		<li>In addition, there are some embedded youtube video tutorials. You should watch these when indicated in the pre-lesson assignments, and when revising. </li>
	      </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can find some really good information from <a href='http://www.chemguide.co.uk/'>Chemguide.co.uk</a> to help you revise and understand the material better.
